				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I'm Joe. I live in Stockton-on-tees.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm probably one of those people you'll see wearing a strange assortment of clothes. Yeah, i'm pretty strange, but that's how everyone knows me.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love the internet and is usually about on most websites, so take the time to look about and say hi!
				</p>
				<p>
					You won't like me on a morning. I'm like a wreck. Just don't try to wake me up and expect me to be in a good mood
				</p>
				<p>
					I love my friends. They mean the world to me and are very supportive of my actions and my views. They are even persuasive and pretty. They are also honest with me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh and also I wrote a guide to <a href="twitter.html">using twitter</a>
				</p>
				<h2>What I Hate</h2>
				<p>
					I hate people who are pathetic, liars and just fucktards. I hate being woke up. I hate people who lie to me every day.
				</p>
