				<h1>About</h1>
				<img src="me.png" style="float: right" title="Me">
				<p>
					Hello there I'm Joe. I'm basically a geeky-minded goth-looking person who resides in <a href="http://maps.google.com/places/gb/cleveland/stockton-on-tees?hl=en">Stockton-on-tees</a>. So basically I know loads about computers (I love website creation, it's lovely). I also Love some awesome tune-age. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I have amazing friends who I love to bits. They are the world to me and help me get through each and every day. If you're a random person, wanting to know me. Look bellow and you'll find loads more info on them. Love you guys. &lt;3
				</p>
				<p>
					I hate people who tag me with stuff like: <i>gay</i>, <b>emo</b> and <u>mosher</u>. Tagging people is really pointless unless you follow the spoon-fed cult of chavs (basically plastic clothes from JD). I don't bite though, i'm pretty friendly :D
				</p>
				<h1>Music</h1>
				<p>
					Music is my life. I love it too much. I mainly listen to metal and rock, only allowing little of much else. Rap and Rave is a definite no-no in my life, it's shit and no talent is involved. I love music with real instruments in like guitars and vocals and drums.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bands I really love involve Bullet For My Valentine, Slipknot, Rammstein and loads more. I love many unsigned bands too, they are awesomeness! If you would love to see what I have been listening to recently, just click the magic Last.FM button bellow to see my profile over there!

				<h1>Art</h1>
				<p>
					I love drawing, writing and move making videos with my Bloggie. I do loads of drawing and writing and that's all posted on my deviantArt account. My video is using non-copyrighted stuff, as i'm that nice to all the copyrighting people. All of my artwork is under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons</a>, so you can copy it as long as you don't sell it (I can sue you then!)
