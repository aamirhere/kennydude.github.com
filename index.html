				<h1>About</h1>
				<img src="me.png" style="float: right" title="Me">
				<p>
					Hello there I'm Joe. I'm basically a geeky-minded goth-looking person who resides in <a href="http://maps.google.com/places/gb/cleveland/stockton-on-tees?hl=en">Stockton-on-tees</a>. So basically I know loads about computers (I love website creation, it's lovely). I also Love some awesome tune-age. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I have amazing friends who I love to bits. They are the world to me and help me get through each and every day. If you're a random person, wanting to know me. Look bellow and you'll find loads more info on them. Love you guys. &lt;3
				</p>
				<p>
					I hate people who tag me with stuff like: <i>gay</i>, <b>emo</b> and <u>mosher</u>. Tagging people is really pointless unless you follow the spoon-fed cult of chavs (basically plastic clothes from JD). I don't bite though, i'm pretty friendly :D
				</p>
				<h1>Music</h1>
				<p>
					Music is my life. I love it too much. I mainly listen to metal and rock, only allowing little of much else. Rap and Rave is a definite no-no in my life, it's shit and no talent is involved. I love music with real instruments in like guitars and vocals and drums.
				</p>
				<p>
					The bands I really love involve Bullet For My Valentine, Slipknot, Rammstein and loads more. I love many unsigned bands too, they are awesomeness! If you would love to see what I have been listening to recently, just click the magic Last.FM button in the top to see my profile over there!
				</p>
				<h1>Art</h1>
				<p>
					I love drawing, writing and movie making videos with my Bloggie. I do loads of drawing and writing and that's all posted on my deviantArt account. My video is using non-copyrighted stuff, as i'm that nice to all the copyrighting people. All of my artwork is under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons</a>, so you can copy it as long as you don't sell it (I can sue you then!)
				</p>
				<h1>Friends</h1>
				<p>
					My friends are really really really awesomeorific. They really are and help me get through every day. My friends won't tell anything I tell them not too and are a great laugh in and out of school. I even have my best friend as my '<a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1333537467">twin sister</a>' as we're very alike.
				</p>
				<h1>Family</h1>
				<p>
					I've got <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kennydude/4510506675/" title="A picture of my doggie">my doggie</a> who is awesome and he loves me very much for taking him out for walkies a lot and give him biscuits. Also there is my mammy and daddy. Then there's my real siblings (aha! posh word!) who are Calvin and Eleanor (boy and girl).
				</p>
				<h1>Photos</h1>
				<p>
					I also love taking photos with my amazing Sony Bloggie. I post them to my flickr account, which is usually busting with fullness. Please use the sets to actually find something - i kinda filled the 200 for free members really easily
